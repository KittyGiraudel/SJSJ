This is particularly well suited for the browser environment where synchronous loading of modules incurs performance, usability, debugging, and cross-domain access problems.\n\nAMD libraries expose a global `define` function whose footprint is\n\n```js\ndefine(modulename?,[dependencyA?, dependencyB?, ...], function (objectA, objectB, ...) {\n...\n    var myExportedObj = function() {...}\n    return myExportedObj;\n\n});\n```\n\nWhere\n\n- `modulename` is an optional string parameter to explicitly declare the id of the current module\n- `dependencyA`, `dependencyB` and so on, are the dependencies for the current module\n- `function(objectA, objectB) {...}` is a factory whose arguments are the exported objects of each dependency.\n- `myExportedObj` an optional return value (since a module might be just adding methods to an existing object) but, if declared, it would be this module's exported object, which other modules would get if they list `modulename` among their dependencies.\n\nAside from the global `define` function, an AMD compliant library must have a `define.amd` property whose value is an object. Checking for the existence of both `define` and `define.amd` in the global scope allows any script to verify it is being called from an AMD loader.\n\nExamples of libraries providing AMD loading capabilities are:\n\n- [RequireJS](REQUIREJS.md) written by Mozilla’s [James Burke](https://github.com/jrburke/). One of the first ones to become widely used and still the most popular. It provides a limited interoperability with [CommonJS](COMMONJS.md) modules too.\n- [CurlJS](https://github.com/cujojs/curl) part of the [CujoJS Framework](http://cujojs.com/). CurlJS is less popular than RequireJS and is receiving only maintenance updates, no new features since 2014.\n- [Alameda](https://github.com/requirejs/alameda) also made by James Burke, it's like RequireJS but using promises to manage the completion events.\n- [Cajon](https://github.com/requirejs/cajon) also made by James Burke, it's like a decorator for RequireJS that replaces the `load` method to fetch dependencies through [AJAX](AJAX.md) calls.\n- [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) by [Guy Bedford](https://github.com/guybedford) who, until a couple of years ago, was one of the most active plugin developers for RequireJS.

There’s usually an optional (but reccomended) build or bundling step for production deploys, in order to minify the code and minimize the number of requests in order to enhance load times. Allegedly, the coming of [HTTP2](https://http2.github.io/) support in browsers and webservers should eliminate the need for extra requests when loading dependencies asynchronously, thus eliminating the need of a build step.\n\nOther libraries that can’t load dependencies asynchronously but can include AMD modules in their build workflow, are, for example:\n\n- [Webpack](WEBPACK.md)\n- [Rollup](http://rollupjs.org/)\n- [StealJS](http://stealjs.com/)\n",

    "markdown": "[Apache Cordova](http://phonegap.com/) (formerly **PhoneGap**) is a popular mobile application development framework originally created by Nitobi. Adobe Systems purchased Nitobi in 2011, rebranded it as PhoneGap, and later released an open source version of the software called Apache Cordova. Apache Cordova enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in Android, iOS, or Windows Phone. It enables wrapping up of CSS, HTML, and JavaScript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and JavaScript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via Web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely Web-based (because they are not just Web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs). Mixing native and hybrid code snippets has been possible since version 1.9.\n\nThe software was previously called just \"PhoneGap\", then \"Apache Callback\". As open-source software, Apache Cordova allows wrappers around it, such as Intel XDK or Appery.io.\n\nPhoneGap is Adobe’s productized version and ecosystem on top of Cordova. Like PhoneGap, many other tools and frameworks are also built on top of Cordova, including Ionic, the Intel XDK, Monaca, TACO, and the Telerik Platform. These tools use Cordova, and not PhoneGap for their core tools.\n\nContributors to the Apache Cordova project include Adobe, IBM, Google, Microsoft, Intel, BlackBerry, Mozilla, and others.\n\n## History\n\nFirst developed at an iPhoneDevCamp event in San Francisco, PhoneGap went on to win the People's Choice Award at O'Reilly Media's 2009 Web 2.0 Conference, and the framework has been used to develop many apps. Apple Inc. has confirmed that the framework has its approval, even with the new 4.0 developer license agreement changes. The PhoneGap framework is used by several mobile application platforms such as Asial's Monaca, ViziApps, Worklight, Convertigo, and appMobi as the backbone of their mobile client development engine.\n\nAdobe officially announced the acquisition of Nitobi Software (the original developer) on October 4, 2011. Coincident with that, the PhoneGap code was contributed to the Apache Software Foundation to start a new project called Apache Cordova. The project's original name, Apache Callback, was viewed as too generic. Then it also appears in Adobe Systems as Adobe PhoneGap and also as Adobe Phonegap Build.\n\nEarly versions of PhoneGap required an Apple computer to create iOS apps and a Windows computer to create Windows Mobile apps. After September 2012, Adobe's PhoneGap Build service allows programmers to upload HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code to a \"cloud compiler\" that generates apps for every supported platform.\n\n## Design and rationale\n\nThe core of Apache Cordova applications use HTML5 and CSS3 for their rendering and JavaScript for their logic. HTML5 now provides access to underlying hardware such as the accelerometer, camera, and GPS. However, browser support for HTML5-based device access is not consistent across mobile browsers, particularly older versions of Android. To overcome these limitations, Apache Cordova embeds HTML5 code inside a native WebView on the device, using a foreign function interface to access the native resources of the device.\n\nApache Cordova can be extended with native plug-ins that allow for developers to add functionality that can be called from JavaScript, allowing for direct communication between the native layer and the HTML5 page. Apache Cordova includes basic plugins that allow access to the device's accelerometer, camera, microphone, compass, file system, and more.\n\nHowever, the use of Web-based technologies leads some Apache Cordova applications to run slower than native applications with similar functionality. Adobe Systems warns that applications may be rejected by Apple for being too slow or not feeling \"native\" enough (having appearance and functionality consistent with what users have come to expect on the platform). This can be an issue for some Apache Cordova applications.\n\n## Supported platforms\n\nAs of January 2016, Apache Cordova currently supports development for the operating systems Apple iOS, BlackBerry, Google Android, LG webOS, Microsoft Windows Phone (7 and 8), Nokia Symbian OS, Tizen (SDK 2.x), Bada, Firefox OS, and Ubuntu Touch. The table below is a list of supported features for each operating system.\n\n| Feature | iPhone | Android | Windows Phone | BlackBerry OS | Bada | Symbian | Tizen |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Accelerometer | Yes | Yes | Yes | 5.0+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Camera | Yes | Yes | Yes | 5.0+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Compass | 3GS+ | Yes | Yes | 10+ | Yes | **N/A** | Yes |\n| Contacts | Yes | Yes | Yes | 5.0+ | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| File | Yes | Yes | Yes | 5.0+ | Yes | **N/A** | Yes |\n| Geolocation | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Media | Yes | Yes | Yes | 10+ | **N/A** | **N/A** | Yes |\n| Network | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Notification | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| Storage | Yes | Yes | Yes | 5.0+ | **N/A** | Yes | Yes |\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [Apache Cordova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cordova)*.

    "markdown": "The [Closure Compiler](https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/) is a tool for making JavaScript download and run faster. It is a true compiler for JavaScript. Instead of compiling from a source language to machine code, it compiles from JavaScript to better JavaScript. It parses your JavaScript, analyzes it, removes dead code and rewrites and minimizes what's left. It also checks syntax, variable references, and types, and warns about common JavaScript pitfalls.\n\n## Usage\n\n*Closure-compiler requires java to be installed and in the path.*\n\nThe compiler package now includes build tool plugins for [Grunt](GRUNT.md) and [Gulp](GULP.md).\n\n### Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm install --save google-closure-compiler\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe compiler has a large number of flags. The best documentation for the flags can be found by running the `--help` command of the `compiler.jar` found inside the `node_modules/google-closure-compiler` folder:\n\n```sh\njava -jar compiler.jar --help\n```\n\n### Specifying Options\n\nBoth the grunt and gulp tasks take options objects. The option parameters map directly to the compiler flags without the leading '--' characters.\n\nValues are either strings or booleans. Options which have multiple values can be arrays.\n\n```js\n{\n  js: ['/file-one.js', '/file-two.js'],\n  compilation_level: 'ADVANCED',\n  js_output_file: 'out.js',\n  debug: true\n}\n```\n\nFor advanced usages, the options may be specified as an array of strings. These values include the \"--\" characters and are directly passed to the compiler in the order specified:\n\n```js\n[\n  '--js', '/file-one.js',\n  '--js', '/file-two.js',\n  '--compilation_level', 'ADVANCED',\n  '--js_output_file', 'out.js',\n  '--debug'\n]\n```\n\nWhen an array of flags is passed, the input files should not be specified via the build tools, but rather as compilation flags directly.\n\nSome shells (particularly windows) try to do expansion on globs rather than passing the string on to the compiler. To prevent this it is necessary to quote certain arguments:\n\n```js\n{\n  js: '\"my/quoted/glob/**.js\"',\n  compilation_level: 'ADVANCED',\n  js_output_file: 'out.js',\n  debug: true\n}\n```\n\n## Using the Grunt Task\n\nInclude the plugin in your `Gruntfile.js`:\n\n```js\nrequire('google-closure-compiler').grunt(grunt);\n// The load-grunt-tasks plugin won't automatically load closure-compiler\n```\n \nTask targets, files and options may be specified according to the grunt [Configuring tasks](http://gruntjs.com/configuring-tasks) guide.\n\n### Basic Configuration Example:\n\n```js\nrequire('google-closure-compiler').grunt(grunt);\n \n// Project configuration. \ngrunt.initConfig({\n  'closure-compiler': {\n    my_target: {\n      files: {\n        'dest/output.min.js': ['src/js/**/*.js']\n      },\n      options: {\n        compilation_level: 'SIMPLE',\n        language_in: 'ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT',\n        create_source_map: 'dest/output.min.js.map',\n        output_wrapper: '(function(){\\n%output%\\n}).call(this)\\n//# sourceMappingURL=output.min.js.map'\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Using the Gulp Plugin\n\nThe gulp plugin supports piping multiple files through the compiler.\n\nOptions are a direct match to the compiler flags without the leading \"--\".\n\n### Basic Configuration Example:\n\n```js\nvar closureCompiler = require('google-closure-compiler').gulp();\n \ngulp.task('js-compile', function () {\n  return gulp.src('./src/js/**/*.js', {base: './'})\n      .pipe(closureCompiler({\n          compilation_level: 'SIMPLE',\n          warning_level: 'VERBOSE',\n          language_in: 'ECMASCRIPT6_STRICT',\n          language_out: 'ECMASCRIPT5_STRICT',\n          output_wrapper: '(function(){\\n%output%\\n}).call(this)',\n          js_output_file: 'output.min.js'\n        }))\n      .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/js'));\n});\n```\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [Google Closure Compiler](https://github.com/google/closure-compiler)*.

    "name": "Design Patterns",
    "markdown": "In software engineering, a [design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) is a general reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. A design pattern is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code. It is a description or template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many different situations. Patterns are formalized best practices that the programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.\n\nDesign patterns may be viewed as a structured approach to computer programming intermediate between the levels of a programming paradigm and a concrete algorithm.\n\n## Types\n\nDesign patterns reside in the domain of modules and interconnections. At a higher level there are architectural patterns which are larger in scope, usually describing an overall pattern followed by an entire system.\n\nThere are many types of design patterns, for instance:\n\n- **Algorithm strategy patterns** addressing concerns related to high-level strategies describing how to exploit application characteristics on a computing platform.\n- **Computational design patterns** addressing concerns related to key computation identification.\n- **Execution patterns** which address issues related to lower-level support of application execution, including strategies for executing streams of tasks and for the definition of building blocks to support task synchronization.\n- **Implementation strategy patterns** addressing concerns related to implementing source code to support\n 1. program organization, and\n 2. the common data structures specific to parallel programming.\n- **Structural design patterns** addressing concerns related to global structures of applications being developed.\n\n## History\n\nPatterns originated as an architectural concept by [Christopher Alexander](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander) (1977/79). In 1987, [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) and [Ward Cunningham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham) began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the [OOPSLA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOPSLA) conference that year. In the following years, Beck, Cunningham and others followed up on this work.\n\nDesign patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_(book)) was published in 1994 by the so-called \"Gang of Four\" (Gamma et al.), which is frequently abbreviated as \"GoF\". That same year, the first Pattern Languages of Programming Conference was held and the following year, the Portland Pattern Repository was set up for documentation of design patterns.

ISBN 0-596-00712-4.\n\nAlthough design patterns have been applied practically for a long time, formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years.\n\n## Practice\n\nDesign patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms. Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.\n\nIn order to achieve flexibility, design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection, which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance.\n\nBy definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.\n\nSoftware design techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.\n\n## Classification and list\n\nDesign patterns were originally grouped into the categories: *creational patterns*, *structural patterns*, and *behavioral patterns*, and described using the concepts of delegation, aggregation, and consultation. For further background on object-oriented design, see coupling and cohesion, inheritance, interface, and polymorphism. Another classification has also introduced the notion of architectural design pattern that may be applied at the architecture level of the software such as the Model–View–Controller pattern.\n\n### Creational patterns\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Abstract factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern) | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. |\n| [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern) | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations. |\n| [Factory method](FACTORY_PATTERN.md) | Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses (dependency injection). |\n| [Lazy initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization) | Tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed. This pattern appears in the GoF catalog as \"virtual proxy\", an implementation strategy for the Proxy pattern. |\n| [Multiton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiton_pattern) | Ensure a class has only named instances, and provide a global point of access to them. |\n| [Object pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_pool_pattern) | Avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use. Can be considered a generalisation of connection pool and thread pool patterns. |\n| [Prototype](PROTOTYPE_PATTERN.md) | Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. |\n| [Resource acquisition is initialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Acquisition_Is_Initialization) | Ensure that resources are properly released by tying them to the lifespan of suitable objects. |\n| [Singleton](SINGLETON_PATTERN.md) | Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it. |\n\n### Structural patterns\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) or Wrapper or Translator | Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. An adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatible interfaces. The enterprise integration pattern equivalent is the translator. |\n| [Bridge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridge_pattern) | Decouple an abstraction from its implementation allowing the two to vary independently. |\n| [Composite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern) | \tCompose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. |\n| [Decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) | \tAttach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically keeping the same interface. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality. |\n| [Facade](FACADE_PATTERN.md) | Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use. |\n| [Flyweight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyweight_pattern) | Use sharing to support large numbers of similar objects efficiently. |\n| [Front controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_controller) | The pattern relates to the design of Web applications. It provides a centralized entry point for handling requests. |\n| [Marker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marker_interface_pattern) | Empty interface to associate metadata with a class. |\n| [Module](MODULE_PATTERN.md) | \tGroup several related elements, such as classes, singletons, methods, globally used, into a single conceptual entity. |\n| [Proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern) | Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. |\n| [Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_pattern) | Twin allows modeling of multiple inheritance in programming languages that do not support this feature. |\n\n### Behavioural patterns\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Blackboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackboard_design_pattern) | Artificial intelligence pattern for combining disparate sources of data (see blackboard system) |\n| [Chain of responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_responsibility_pattern) | Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it. |\n| [Command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_pattern) | Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations. |\n| [Interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_pattern) | Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language. |\n| [Iterator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern) | Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation. |\n| [Mediator](MEDIATOR_PATTERN.md) | Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently. |\n| [Memento](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern) | Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state allowing the object to be restored to this state later. |\n| [Null object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Object_pattern) | Avoid null references by providing a default object. |\n| [Observer](OBSERVER_PATTERN.md) or [Publish/subscribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish/subscribe) | Define a one-to-many dependency between objects where a state change in one object results in all its dependents being notified and updated automatically. |\n| [Servant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_Servant) | Define common functionality for a group of classes. |\n| [Specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_pattern) | Recombinable business logic in a Boolean fashion. |\n| [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) | Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class. |\n| [Strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern) | Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it. |\n| [Template method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_method_pattern) | Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure. |\n| [Visitor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) | Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates. |\n\n### Concurrency patterns\n\n| Name | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| [Active Object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_object) | Decouples method execution from method invocation that reside in their own thread of control. The goal is to introduce concurrency, by using asynchronous method invocation and a scheduler for handling requests. |\n| [Balking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balking_pattern) | Only execute an action on an object when the object is in a particular state. |\n| [Binding properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_properties_pattern) | Combining multiple observers to force properties in different objects to be synchronized or coordinated in some way. |\n| [Block chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_chain_(database)) | Decentralized way to store data and agree on ways of processing it in a Merkle tree, optionally using Digital signature for any individual contributions. |\n| [Double-checked locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_checked_locking_pattern) | Reduce the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion (the 'lock hint') in an unsafe manner; only if that succeeds does the actual locking logic proceed. Can be unsafe when implemented in some language/hardware combinations. It can therefore sometimes be considered an anti-pattern. |\n| [Event-based asynchronous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-Based_Asynchronous_Pattern) | Addresses problems with the asynchronous pattern that occur in multithreaded programs. |\n| [Guarded suspension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_suspension) | \tManages operations that require both a lock to be acquired and a precondition to be satisfied before the operation can be executed. |\n| [Join](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join-pattern) | Join-pattern provides a way to write concurrent, parallel and distributed programs by message passing. Compared to the use of threads and locks, this is a high-level programming model. |\n| [Lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)) | One thread puts a \"lock\" on a resource, preventing other threads from accessing or modifying it. |\n| [Messaging design pattern (MDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Messaging_pattern) | Allows the interchange of information (i.e. messages) between components and applications. |\n| [Monitor object](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)) | \tAn object whose methods are subject to mutual exclusion, thus preventing multiple objects from erroneously trying to use it at the same time. |\n| [Reactor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactor_pattern) | A reactor object provides an asynchronous interface to resources that must be handled synchronously. |\n| [Read-write lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read/write_lock_pattern) | Allows concurrent read access to an object, but requires exclusive access for write operations. |\n| [Scheduler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduler_pattern) | Explicitly control when threads may execute single-threaded code. |\n| [Thread pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_pool_pattern) | \tA number of threads are created to perform a number of tasks, which are usually organized in a queue. Typically, there are many more tasks than threads. Can be considered a special case of the object pool pattern. |\n| [Thread-specific storage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread-Specific_Storage) | Static or \"global\" memory local to a thread. |\n\n## Documentation\n\nThe documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used, the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve, and the suggested solution. There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors. However, according to Martin Fowler, certain pattern forms have become more well-known than others, and consequently become common starting points for new pattern-writing efforts. One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides (collectively known as the \"Gang of Four\", or GoF for short) in their book Design Patterns. It contains the following sections:\n\n- **Pattern Name and Classification**: A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.\n- **Intent**: A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.\n- **Also Known As**: Other names for the pattern.\n- **Motivation (Forces)**: A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.\n- **Applicability**: Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.\n- **Structure**: A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose.\n- **Participants**: A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.\n- **Collaboration**: A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.\n- **Consequences**: A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.\n- **Implementation**: A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.\n- **Sample Code**: An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.\n- **Known Uses**: Examples of real usages of the pattern.\n- **Related Patterns**: Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n- [Software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)*.

Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns.</p>\n<p>In order to achieve flexibility, design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection, which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance.</p>\n<p>By definition, a pattern must be programmed anew into each application that uses it. Since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components, researchers have worked to turn patterns into components. Meyer and Arnout were able to provide full or partial componentization of two-thirds of the patterns they attempted.</p>\n<p>Software design techniques are difficult to apply to a broader range of problems. Design patterns provide general solutions, documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem.</p>\n<h2 id=\"classification-and-list\">Classification and list</h2>\n<p>Design patterns were originally grouped into the categories: <em>creational patterns</em>, <em>structural patterns</em>, and <em>behavioral patterns</em>, and described using the concepts of delegation, aggregation, and consultation. For further background on object-oriented design, see coupling and cohesion, inheritance, interface, and polymorphism. Another classification has also introduced the notion of architectural design pattern that may be applied at the architecture level of the software such as the Model–View–Controller pattern.</p>\n<h3 id=\"creational-patterns\">Creational patterns</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Name</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern\">Abstract factory</a></td>\n<td>Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\">Builder</a></td>\n<td>Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create various representations.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><a href=\"FACTORY_PATTERN.md\">Factory method</a></td>\n<td>Define an interface for creating a single object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

There is no single, standard format for documenting design patterns. Rather, a variety of different formats have been used by different pattern authors. However, according to Martin Fowler, certain pattern forms have become more well-known than others, and consequently become common starting points for new pattern-writing efforts. One example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides (collectively known as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;, or GoF for short) in their book Design Patterns. It contains the following sections:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Pattern Name and Classification</strong>: A descriptive and unique name that helps in identifying and referring to the pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Intent</strong>: A description of the goal behind the pattern and the reason for using it.</li>\n<li><strong>Also Known As</strong>: Other names for the pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Motivation (Forces)</strong>: A scenario consisting of a problem and a context in which this pattern can be used.</li>\n<li><strong>Applicability</strong>: Situations in which this pattern is usable; the context for the pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Structure</strong>: A graphical representation of the pattern. Class diagrams and Interaction diagrams may be used for this purpose.</li>\n<li><strong>Participants</strong>: A listing of the classes and objects used in the pattern and their roles in the design.</li>\n<li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: A description of how classes and objects used in the pattern interact with each other.</li>\n<li><strong>Consequences</strong>: A description of the results, side effects, and trade offs caused by using the pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Implementation</strong>: A description of an implementation of the pattern; the solution part of the pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Sample Code</strong>: An illustration of how the pattern can be used in a programming language.</li>\n<li><strong>Known Uses</strong>: Examples of real usages of the pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Related Patterns</strong>: Other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Source:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern\">Software design pattern</a><em>.

    "markdown": "The [Facade Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) (**or façade pattern**) is a software design pattern commonly used with *object-oriented programming*. The name is by analogy to an architectural facade.\n\nA facade is an object that provides a simplified interface to a larger body of code, such as a class library. A facade can:\n\n- make a software library easier to use, understand and test, since the facade has convenient methods for common tasks;\n- make the library more readable, for the same reason;\n- reduce dependencies of outside code on the inner workings of a library, since most code uses the facade, thus allowing more flexibility in developing the system;\n- wrap a poorly designed collection of APIs with a single well-designed API.\n\nThe Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client. It typically involves a single wrapper class which contains a set of members required by client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.\n\n## Usage\n\nA Facade is used when an easier or simpler interface to an underlying object is desired. Alternatively, an [adapter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern) can be used when the wrapper must respect a particular interface and must support polymorphic behavior. A [decorator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decorator_pattern) makes it possible to add or alter behavior of an interface at run-time.\n\n| Pattern | Intent |\n|---|---|\n| Adapter | Converts one interface to another so that it matches what the client is expecting |\n| Decorator | Dynamically adds responsibility to the interface by wrapping the original code |\n| Facade | Provides a simplified interface |\n\nThe facade pattern is typically used when:\n\n- a simple interface is required to access a complex system;\n- the abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled;\n- need an entry point to each level of layered software; or\n- a system is very complex or difficult to understand.\n\n## Structure\n\n![Example of Facade design pattern in UML](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/57/Example_of_Facade_design_pattern_in_UML.png)\n\n**Facade**: The facade class abstracts Packages 1, 2, and 3 from the rest of the application.\n**Clients**: The objects are using the Facade Pattern to access resources from the Packages.\n\n## Example\n\nThis is an abstract example of how a client (“you”) interacts with a facade (the “computer”) to a complex system (internal computer parts, like CPU and HardDrive).\n\n```js\n/* Complex parts */\n\nclass CPU {\n    freeze() { /* code here */ }\n    jump(position) { /* code here */ }\n    execute() { /* code here */ }\n}\n\nclass Memory {\n    load(position, data) { /* code here */ }\n}\n\nclass HardDrive {\n    read(lba, size) { /* code here */ }\n}\n\n/* Facade */\n\nclass ComputerFacade {\n  constructor() {\n    this.processor = new Cput();\n    this.ram = new Memory();\n    this.hd = new HardDrive();\n\t}\n\n  start() {\n    this.processor.freeze();\n    this.ram.load(this.BOOT_ADDRESS, this.hd.read(this.BOOT_SECTOR, this.SECTOR_SIZE));\n    this.processor.jump(this.BOOT_ADDRESS);\n    this.processor.execute();\n  }\n}\n\n/* Client */\n\nlet computer = new ComputerFacade();\ncomputer.start();\n\n```\n\n*Source: [Facade pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern).

    "markdown": "[Falcor](https://netflix.github.io/falcor/) is a JavaScript library for efficient data fetching.\n\n### One Model Everywhere\n\nFalcor lets you represent all your remote data sources as a single domain model via a virtual [JSON](JSON.md) graph. You code the same way no matter where the data is, whether in memory on the client or over the network on the server.\n\n### The Data is the API\n\nA JavaScript-like path syntax makes it easy to access as much or as little data as you want, when you want it. You retrieve your data using familiar JavaScript operations like get, set, and call. If you know your data, you know your API.\n\n### Bind to the Cloud\n\nFalcor automatically traverses references in your graph and makes requests as needed. Falcor transparently handles all network communications, opportunistically batching and de-duping requests.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nYou can check out a working example server for a Netflix-like application [here](http://github.com/netflix/falcor-express-demo) right now. Alternately you can go through this barebones tutorial in which we use the Falcor Router to create a Virtual JSON resource. In this tutorial we will use Falcor’s express middleware to serve the Virtual JSON resource on an application server at the URL /model.json. We will also host a static web page on the same server which retrieves data from the Virtual JSON resource.\n\n### Creating a Virtual JSON Resource\n\nIn this example we will use the Falcor Router to build a Virtual JSON resource on an app server and host it at `/model.json`. The JSON resource will contain the following contents:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"greeting\": \"Hello World\"\n}\n```\n\nNormally Routers retrieve the data for their Virtual JSON resource from backend datastores or other web services on-demand. However in this simple tutorial the Router will simply return static data for a single key.\n\nFirst we create a folder for our application server.\n\n```sh\nmkdir falcor-app-server\ncd falcor-app-server\nnpm init\n```\n\nNow we install the falcor Router.\n\n```sh\nnpm install falcor-router --save\n```\n\nThen install express and falcor-express. Support for [restify](https://github.com/netflix/falcor-restify), and [Hapi](https://github.com/netflix/falcor-hapi) is also available.\n\n```sh\nnpm install express --save\nnpm install falcor-express --save\n```\n\nNow we create an `index.js` file with the following contents:\n\n```js\n// index.js\nvar falcorExpress = require('falcor-express');\nvar Router = require('falcor-router');\n\nvar express = require('express');\nvar app = express();\n\napp.use('/model.json', falcorExpress.dataSourceRoute(function (req, res) {\n  // create a Virtual JSON resource with single key (\"greeting\")\n  return new Router([\n    {\n      // match a request for the key \"greeting\"    \n      route: 'greeting',\n      // respond with a PathValue with the value of 'Hello World.'\n      get: function () {\n        return {\n          path: ['greeting'],\n          value: 'Hello World'\n        };\n      }\n    }\n  ]);\n}));\n\n// serve static files from current directory\napp.use(express.static(__dirname + '/'));\n\nvar server = app.listen(3000);\n```\n\nNow we run the server, which will listen on port 3000 for requests for `/model.json`.\n\n```sh\nnode index.js\n```\n\n### Retrieving Data from the Virtual JSON resource\n\nNow that we’ve built a simple virtual JSON document with a single read-only key “greeting”, we will create a test web page and retrieve this key from the server.\n\nNow create an index.html file with the following contents:\n\n```html\n<!-- index.html -->\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <!-- Do _not_  rely on this URL in production. Use only during development.  -->\n    <script src=\"//netflix.github.io/falcor/build/falcor.browser.js\"></script>\n    <script>\n      var model = new falcor.Model({\n        source: new falcor.HttpDataSource('/model.json')\n      });\n\n      // retrieve the \"greeting\" key from the root of the Virtual JSON resource\n      model\n        .get('greeting')\n        .then(function (response) {\n          document.write(response.json.greeting);\n        });\n    </script>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nNow visit http://localhost:3000/index.html and you should see the message retrieved from the server:\n\n![“Hello world” demo from Falcor rendering in a browser](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/starter/helloworld.png)\n\n*This section was taken from [Falcor documentation site](http://netflix.github.io/falcor/).*\n",

    "markdown": "[Flow](http://flowtype.org/) is a static type checker for JavaScript. It can be used to catch common bugs in JavaScript programs - such as silent type conversions, null dereferences and so on - often without requiring any changes to your code. It also adds type syntax to JavaScript, so that developers can express invariants about their code and have them maintained automatically.\n\nFlow's type checking is **opt-in**: files are not type checked unless you ask it to. This means that you can gradually convert your JavaScript codebase to Flow while reaping incremental benefits. When you do opt-in a file, Flow tries to type check the code automatically by performing type inference, reporting errors without further manual guidance. This simple workflow is usually sufficient when your codebase is broken down into small files, each defining a module that exports a well-defined interface. However, for some files (e.g., monolithic libraries), the analysis Flow performs might turn out to be too imprecise, causing lots of spurious errors to be reported. In such cases, the developer can either try to manually guide Flow with type annotations, or switch to a [weaker mode](http://flowtype.org/docs/existing.html#weak-mode) with limited type inference to reduce noise.\n\nFlow's type checking is **online**: it performs an initial analysis of all files in a code base, and then monitors those files for subsequent changes, type checking them and other dependencies piecemeal and proactively in the background. For the developer, this means that there are no perceptible compile-time delays; saving a bunch of files in an editor or rebasing a set of files in a repository automatically triggers type checking, storing the results in a persistent server, so that they are available instantaneously when queried.\n\n## How does it work?\n\nFlow designed to find type errors in JavaScript programs:\n\n```js\n/* @flow */\nfunction foo(x) {\n  return x * 10;\n}\nfoo('Hello, world!');\n\n```\n\n```sh\n$> flow\n\nhello.js:5:5,19: string\nThis type is incompatible with\n  hello.js:3:10,15: number\n```\n\nFlow also lets you gradually evolve JavaScript code into typed code:\n\n```js\n/* @flow */\nfunction foo(x: string, y: number): string {\n  return x.length * y;\n}\nfoo('Hello', 42);\n```\n\n```sh\n$> flow\n\nhello.js:3:10,21: number\nThis type is incompatible with\n  hello.js:2:37,42: string\n```\n\nTyped Flow code easily transforms down to regular JavaScript, so it runs anywhere.\n\n## Why Flow?\n\nThe goal of Flow is to find errors in JavaScript code with little programmer effort. Flow relies heavily on **type inference** to find type errors even when the program has not been annotated - it precisely tracks the types of variables as they flow through the program.\n\nAt the same time, Flow is a **gradual** type system. Any parts of your program that are dynamic in nature can easily bypass the type checker, so you can mix statically typed code with dynamic code.\n\nFlow also supports a highly **expressive** type language. Flow types can express much more fine-grained distinctions than traditional type systems. For example, Flow helps you catch errors involving null, unlike most type systems.\n\n## Using Flow\n\nStart with [Getting Started](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html) guide to download and try Flow yourself. Flow is open-source, so you can also start with the code on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/facebook/flow).\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [Flow | A static type checker for JavaScript](http://flowtype.org/)*.*",

It's otherwise exactly the same as the [localStorage API](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/06/localstorage/).\n\n```js\n// In localStorage, we would do:\nvar obj = { value: \"hello world\" };\nlocalStorage.setItem('key', JSON.stringify(obj));\nalert(obj.value);\n\n// With localForage, we use callbacks:\nlocalforage.setItem('key', obj, function(err, result) { alert(result.value); });\n```\n\nSimilarly, please don't expect a return value from calls to `localforage.getItem()`. Instead, use a callback:\n\n```js\n// Synchronous; slower!\nvar value = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('key'));\nalert(value);\n\n// Async, fast, and non-blocking!\nlocalforage.getItem('key', function(err, value) { alert(value) });\n```\n\nCallbacks in localForage are Node-style (error argument first) since version `0.9.3`. This means if you're using callbacks, your code should look like this:\n\n```js\n// Use err as your first argument.\nlocalforage.getItem('key', function(err, value) {\n    if (err) {\n        console.error('Oh noes!');\n    } else {\n        alert(value);\n    }\n});\n```\n\nYou can store any type in localForage; you aren't limited to strings like in localStorage. Even if localStorage is your storage backend, localForage automatically does `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` when getting/setting values.\n\n### Promises\n\nPromises are pretty cool! If you'd rather use promises than callbacks, localForage supports that too:\n\n```js\nfunction doSomethingElse(value) {\n    console.log(value);\n}\n\n// With localForage, we allow promises:\nlocalforage.setItem('key', 'value').then(doSomethingElse);\n```\n\nWhen using Promises, `err` is **not** the first argument passed to a function. Instead, you handle an error with the rejection part of the Promise:\n\n```js\n// A full setItem() call with Promises.\nlocalforage.setItem('key', 'value').then(function(value) {\n    alert(value + ' was set!');\n}, function(error) {\n    console.error(error);\n});\n```\n\nlocalForage relies on native [ES6 Promises](https://www.promisejs.org/), but [ships with an awesome polyfill](https://github.com/jakearchibald/es6-promise) for browsers that don't support ES6 Promises yet.\n\n### Storing Blobs, TypedArrays, and other JS objects\n\nlocalForage supports storing all native JS objects that can be serialized to JSON, as well as ArrayBuffers, Blobs, and TypedArrays. Check the [API docs](https://mozilla.github.io/localForage/#setitem) for a full list of types supported by localForage.\n\nAll types are supported in every storage backend, though storage limits in localStorage make storing many large Blobs impossible.\n\n### Configuration\n\nYou can set database information with the `config()` method. Available options are `driver`, `name`, `storeName`, `version`, `size`, and `description`.\n\nExample:\n\n```js\nlocalforage.config({\n    driver      : localforage.WEBSQL, // Force WebSQL; same as using setDriver()\n    name        : 'myApp',\n    version     : 1.0,\n    size        : 4980736, // Size of database, in bytes. WebSQL-only for now.\n    storeName   : 'keyvaluepairs', // Should be alphanumeric, with underscores.\n    description : 'some description'\n});\n```\n\n**Note**: you must call `config()` before you interact with your data. This means calling `config()` before using `getItem()`, `setItem()`, `removeItem()`, `clear()`, `key()`, `keys()` or `length()`.\n\n### Multiple instances\n\nYou can create multiple instances of localForage that point to different stores using `createInstance`. All the configuration options used by [`config`](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage#configuration) are supported.\n\n```js\nvar store = localforage.createInstance({\n  name: \"nameHere\"\n});\n\nvar otherStore = localforage.createInstance({\n  name: \"otherName\"\n});\n\n// Setting the key on one of these doesn't affect the other.\nstore.setItem(\"key\", \"value\");\notherStore.setItem(\"key\", \"value2\");\n```\n\n### RequireJS\n\nYou can use localForage with [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/):\n\n```js\ndefine(['localforage'], function(localforage) {\n    // As a callback:\n    localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue', console.log);\n\n    // With a Promise:\n    localforage.setItem('mykey', 'myvalue').then(console.log);\n});\n```\n\n### Browserify and Webpack\n\nlocalForage 1.3+ works with both Browserify and Webpack. If you're using an earlier version of localForage and are having issues with Browserify or Webpack, please upgrade to 1.3.0 or above.\n\nIf you're using localForage in your own build system (eg. browserify or webpack) make sure you have the [required plugins and transformers](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/blob/master/package.json#L24) installed (eg. `$ npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-system-import-transformer`).\n\n### Framework Support\n\nIf you use a framework listed, there's a localForage storage driver for the models in your framework so you can store data offline with localForage. We have drivers for the following frameworks:\n\n- [AngularJS](https://github.com/ocombe/angular-localForage)\n- [Backbone](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage-backbone)\n- [Ember](https://github.com/genkgo/ember-localforage-adapter)\n\n### Custom Drivers\n\nYou can create your own driver if you want; see the [`defineDriver`](https://mozilla.github.io/localForage/#definedriver) API docs.\n\nThere is a [list of custom drivers on the wiki](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/wiki/Custom-Drivers).\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [mozilla/localForage](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage)*.

    "name": "Mediator Pattern",
    "markdown": "In software engineering, the [mediator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern) defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern is considered to be a behavioral pattern due to the way it can alter the program's running behavior.\n\nUsually a program is made up of a large number of classes. So the logic and computation is distributed among these classes. However, as more classes are developed in a program, especially during maintenance and/or refactoring, the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Furthermore, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other classes.\n\nWith the **mediator pattern**, communication between objects is encapsulated with a **mediator** object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby lowering the coupling.\n\n## Definition\n\nThe essence of the Mediator Pattern is to \"define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact\". It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to be varied independently.[1] Client classes can use the mediator to send messages to other clients, and can receive messages from other clients via an event on the mediator class.\n\n## Structure\n\n![Mediator Pattern structure](http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/javascript/javascript-mediator.jpg)\n\nThe objects participating in this pattern are:\n\n- **Mediator** - In sample code: `Chatroom`\n - defines an interface for communicating with `Colleague` objects\n - maintains references to `Colleague` objects\n - manages central control over operations\n- **Colleagues** - In sample code: `Participants`\n - objects that are being mediated by the `Mediator`\n - each instance maintains a reference to the `Mediator`\n\n## Example\n\nIn the example code we have four participants that are joining in a chat session by registering with a Chatroom (the Mediator). Each participant is represented by a Participant object. Participants send messages to each other and the Chatroom handles the routing.\n\nThis example is simple, but other complex rules could have been added, such as a 'junk filter' to protect participants from receiving junk messages.\n\nThe log function is a helper which collects and displays results.\n\n```js\nclass Participant {\n    constructor(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.chatroom = null;\n    }\n\n    send(message, to) {\n        this.chatroom.send(message, this, to);\n    },\n    receive(message, from) {\n        log.add(from.name + \" to \" + this.name + \": \" + message);\n    }\n}\n \nlet Chatroom = function() {\n        let participants = {};\n\n        return { \n            register: function(participant) {\n                participants[participant.name] = participant;\n                participant.chatroom = this;\n            },\n            send: function(message, from, to) {\n                if (to) {                      // single message\n                    to.receive(message, from);    \n                } else {                       // broadcast message\n                    for (let key in participants) {   \n                        if (participants[key] !== from) {\n                            participants[key].receive(message, from);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        };\n    },\n\n    // log helper\n    log = (function() {\n        let log = '';\n\n        return {\n            add: msg => { log += msg + '\\n'; },\n            show: () => { alert(log); log = ''; }\n        }\n    })();\n \nfunction run() {\n    let yoko = new Participant('Yoko'),\n        john = new Participant('John'),\n        paul = new Participant('Paul'),\n        ringo = new Participant('Ringo'),\n        chatroom = new Chatroom(),\n\n    chatroom.register(yoko);\n    chatroom.register(john);\n    chatroom.register(paul);\n    chatroom.register(ringo);\n \n    yoko.send('All you need is love.');\n    yoko.send('I love you John.');\n    john.send('Hey, no need to broadcast', yoko);\n    paul.send('Ha, I heard that!');\n    ringo.send('Paul, what do you think?', paul);\n \n    log.show();\n}\n\nrun();\n```\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [Mediator pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern)*.

It promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it allows their interaction to be varied independently.[1] Client classes can use the mediator to send messages to other clients, and can receive messages from other clients via an event on the mediator class.</p>\n<h2 id=\"structure\">Structure</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/javascript/javascript-mediator.jpg\" alt=\"Mediator Pattern structure\"></p>\n<p>The objects participating in this pattern are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Mediator</strong> - In sample code: <code>Chatroom</code><ul>\n<li>defines an interface for communicating with <code>Colleague</code> objects</li>\n<li>maintains references to <code>Colleague</code> objects</li>\n<li>manages central control over operations</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Colleagues</strong> - In sample code: <code>Participants</code><ul>\n<li>objects that are being mediated by the <code>Mediator</code></li>\n<li>each instance maintains a reference to the <code>Mediator</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example</h2>\n<p>In the example code we have four participants that are joining in a chat session by registering with a Chatroom (the Mediator).

Participants send messages to each other and the Chatroom handles the routing.</p>\n<p>This example is simple, but other complex rules could have been added, such as a &#39;junk filter&#39; to protect participants from receiving junk messages.</p>\n<p>The log function is a helper which collects and displays results.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">class Participant {\n    constructor(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n        this.chatroom = null;\n    }\n\n    send(message, to) {\n        this.chatroom.send(message, this, to);\n    },\n    receive(message, from) {\n        log.add(from.name + &quot; to &quot; + this.name + &quot;: &quot; + message);\n    }\n}\n\nlet Chatroom = function() {\n        let participants = {};\n\n        return { \n            register: function(participant) {\n                participants[participant.name] = participant;\n                participant.chatroom = this;\n            },\n            send: function(message, from, to) {\n                if (to) {                      // single message\n                    to.receive(message, from);    \n                } else {                       // broadcast message\n                    for (let key in participants) {   \n                        if (participants[key] !== from) {\n                            participants[key].receive(message, from);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n        };\n    },\n\n    // log helper\n    log = (function() {\n        let log = &#39;&#39;;\n\n        return {\n            add: msg =&gt; { log += msg + &#39;\\n&#39;; },\n            show: () =&gt; { alert(log); log = &#39;&#39;; }\n        }\n    })();\n\nfunction run() {\n    let yoko = new Participant(&#39;Yoko&#39;),\n        john = new Participant(&#39;John&#39;),\n        paul = new Participant(&#39;Paul&#39;),\n        ringo = new Participant(&#39;Ringo&#39;),\n        chatroom = new Chatroom(),\n\n    chatroom.register(yoko);\n    chatroom.register(john);\n    chatroom.register(paul);\n    chatroom.register(ringo);\n\n    yoko.send(&#39;All you need is love.&#39;);\n    yoko.send(&#39;I love you John.&#39;);\n    john.send(&#39;Hey, no need to broadcast&#39;, yoko);\n    paul.send(&#39;Ha, I heard that!&#39;);\n    ringo.send(&#39;Paul, what do you think?&#39;, paul);\n\n    log.show();\n}\n\nrun();\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Source:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediator_pattern\">Mediator pattern</a><em>.

    "name": "Module Pattern",
    "markdown": "In software engineering, the [module pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern) is a design pattern used to implement the concept of software modules, defined by modular programming, in a programming language with incomplete direct support for the concept.\n\nThis pattern can be implemented in several ways depending on the host programming language, such as the singleton design pattern, object-oriented static members in a class and procedural global functions.\n\n## Structure\n\nThe module software design pattern provides the features and syntactic structure defined by the modular programming paradigm to programming languages that have incomplete support for the concept.\n\n![Module Pattern structure](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Module-software-design-pattern.png)\n\n## Concept\n\nIn software development, source code can be organized into components that accomplish a particular function or contain everything necessary to accomplish a particular task. Modular programming is one of those approaches.\n\nThe concept of a \"module\" is not fully supported in many common programming languages.\n\n## Features\n\nIn order to consider that a Singleton or any group of related code implements this pattern, the following features must be supplied:\n\n- A portion of the code must have global or public access and be designed for use as global/public code. Additional private or protected code can be executed by the main public code.\n- A module must have an initializer function that is equivalent to, or complementary to an object constructor method. This feature is not supported by regular namespaces.\n- A module must have a finalizer function that is equivalent to, or complementary to an object destructor method. This feature is not supported by regular namespaces.\n- Supporting members may require initialization/finalization code that is executed by the module's initializer/finalizer function.\n- Most members are functions that perform operations on elements external to the class, provided as arguments by calling functions. Such functions are \"utilities\", \"tools\" or \"libraries\".\n\n## Example\n\nJavaScript does not have built-in support for modules, but the community has created impressive work-arounds. The two most popular standards are:\n\n- [CommonJS Modules](COMMONJS.md): The dominant implementation of this standard is in Node.js ([Node.js](NODEJS.md) modules have a few features that go beyond CommonJS). Characteristics:\n - Compact syntax\n - Designed for synchronous loading\n - Main use: server\n- [Asynchronous Module Definition (AMD)](AMD.md): The most popular implementation of this standard is [RequireJS](REQUIREJS.md). Characteristics:\n - Slightly more complicated syntax, enabling AMD to work without eval() (or a compilation step).\n - Designed for asynchronous loading\n - Main use: browsers\n\nIn the middle of 2015, [TC39](https://github.com/tc39) have accepted the new standard **ECMAScript 2015** (**ES6**) which supports built-in modules through the new syntax.\n\n#### CommonJS example\n\n##### Definition\n\n```js\n// helper/MathHelper.js\nmodule.exports = {\n    add: function(left, right) {\n        return left + right;\n    },\n\n    times: function(left, right) {\n        return left * right;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n##### Implementation\n\n```js\n// program.js\nvar mathHelper = require('./helper/MathHelper');\n\nconsole.log(mathHelper.add(5, 8)); // 13\nconsole.log(mathHelper.times(3, 4)); // 12\n```\n\n#### AMD example\n\n##### Definition\n\n```js\n// helper/MathHelper.js\ndefine(function() {\n    return {\n        add: function(left, right) {\n            return left + right;\n        },\n\n        times: function(left, right) {\n            return left * right;\n        }\n    }\n});\n```\n\n##### Implementation\n\n```js\n// program.js\nrequirejs(['helper/MathHelper'], function(matHelper) {\n    console.log(mathHelper.add(5, 8)); // 13\n    console.log(mathHelper.times(3, 4)); // 12\n});\n```\n\n#### ES6 example\n\n##### Definition\n\n```js\n// helper/MathHelper.js\nexport function add(left, right) {\n    return left + right;\n}\n\nexport function times(left, right) {\n    return left * right;\n}\n```\n\n##### Implementation\n\n```js\n// program.js\nimport { add, times } from './helper/MathHelper';\n\nconsole.log(add(5, 8)); // 13\nconsole.log(times(3, 4)); // 12\n```\n\n## Module as a design pattern\n\nThe Module pattern can be considered a creational pattern and a structural pattern. It manages the creation and organization of other elements, and groups them as the structural pattern does.\n\nAn object that applies this pattern can provide the equivalent of a namespace, providing the initialization and finalization process of a static class or a class with static members with cleaner, more concise syntax and semantics.\n\nIt supports specific cases where a class or object can be considered structured, procedural data. And, vice versa, migrate structured, procedural data, and considered as object-oriented.\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n- [Module pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Module_pattern)*.

It is used on more than 4% of all websites, and is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries.\n\n> **MooTools** is a collection of JavaScript utilities designed for the intermediate to advanced JavaScript developer.

MooTools originated from [Moo.fx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo.fx), a popular plug-in Proietti produced for Prototype in October 2005, which is still maintained and used.\n\nWhereas Prototype extended—prototyped—many of JavaScript's native String, Array, and Function objects with additional methods, Proietti desired a framework that (at the time) further extended the native Element object as well to offer greater control of the [Document Object Model](DOM.md) (DOM).\n\n## Components\n\nMooTools includes a number of components, but not all need to be loaded for each application. Some of the component categories are:\n\n- **Core**: A collection of utility functions that all the other components require.\n- **More**: An official collection of add-ons that extend the Core and provide enhanced functionality.\n- **Class**: The base library for Class object instantiation.\n- **Natives**: A collection of JavaScript Native Object enhancements. The Natives add functionality, compatibility, and new methods that simplify coding.\n- **Element**: Contains a large number of enhancements and compatibility standardization to the HTML Element object.\n- **Fx**: An advanced effects-API to animate page elements.\n- **Request**: Includes [XHR](XHR.md) interface, Cookie, [JSON](JSON.md), and HTML retrieval-specific tools for developers to exploit.\n- **Window**: Provides a cross-browser interface to client-specific information, such as the dimensions of the window.\n\n## Browser compatibility\n\nMooTools is compatible and tested with:\n\n- Safari 3+\n- Internet Explorer 6+\n- Mozilla Firefox 2+\n- Opera 9+\n- Chrome 4+\n\n## Benefits\n\nMooTools provides the user with a number of advantages over native JavaScript. These include:\n\n- An extensible and modular framework allowing developers to choose their own customized combination of components.\n- MooTools follows object-oriented practices and the DRY principle.\n- An advanced effects component, with optimized transitions such as easing equations used by many Flash developers.\n- Enhancements to the DOM, enabling developers to easily add, modify, select, and delete DOM elements. Storing and retrieving information with Element storage is also supported.\n\nThe framework includes built-in functions for manipulation of CSS, DOM elements, native JavaScript objects, Ajax requests, DOM effects, and more. MooTools also provides a detailed, coherent application programming interface (API) as well as a custom downloads module allowing developers to download only the modules and dependencies they need for a particular app.\n\n## Emphasis on modularity and reusability\n\nEvery JavaScript framework has its philosophy, and MooTools is interested in taking full advantage of the flexibility and power of JavaScript in a way that emphasizes greater modularity and code reuse. MooTools accomplishes these goals in a way that is intuitive to a developer coming from a class-based inheritance language like Java with the MooTools **Class **object.\n\n**Class** is an object of key/value pairs that can contain either properties or methods (functions). **Class** is effortlessly mixed and extended with other Class instantiations allowing for the greatest focus of MooTools: Code reuse achieved through maximizing the power of JavaScript's prototypical inheritance, but in a **Class** object syntax more familiar to classical inheritance models.\n\n## Object-oriented programming\n\nMooTools contains a robust Class creation and inheritance system that resembles most classically based Object-oriented programming languages. For example, the following is MooTools' equivalent of the examples in Wikipedia's polymorphism page:\n\n```js\nvar Animal = new Class({\n\n    initialize: function(name) {\n        this.name = name;\n    }\n\n});\n\nvar Cat = new Class({\n    Extends: Animal,\n\n    talk: function() {\n        return 'Meow!';\n    }\n\n});\n\nvar Dog = new Class({\n\n    Extends: Animal,\n\n    talk: function() {\n        return 'Arf! Arf';\n    }\n\n});\n\nvar animals = {\n    a: new Cat('Missy'),\n    b: new Cat('Mr. Bojangles'),\n    c: new Dog('Lassie')\n};\n\nObject.each(animals, function(animal) {\n    alert(animal.name + ': ' + animal.talk());\n});\n \n// alerts the following:\n//\n// Missy: Meow!\n// Mr. Bojangles: Meow!\n// Lassie: Arf!

    "markdown": "The [observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) is a software design pattern in which an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods. It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems. The Observer pattern is also a key part in the familiar [model–view–controller](MVC.md) (MVC) architectural pattern. The observer pattern is implemented in numerous programming libraries and systems, including almost all GUI toolkits.\n\nThe observer pattern can cause memory leaks, known as the [lapsed listener problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapsed_listener_problem), because in basic implementation it requires both explicit registration and explicit deregistration, as in the dispose pattern, because the subject holds strong references to the observers, keeping them alive. This can be prevented by the subject holding weak references to the observers.\n\n## Definition\n\nDefine a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe Observer pattern offers a subscription model in which objects subscribe to an event and get notified when the event occurs. This pattern is the cornerstone of event driven programming, including JavaScript. The Observer pattern facilitates good object-oriented design and promotes loose coupling.\n\nWhen building web apps you end up writing many event handlers. Event handlers are functions that will be notified when a certain event fires. These notifications optionally receive an event argument with details about the event (for example the x and y position of the mouse at a click event).\n\nThe event and event-handler paradigm in JavaScript is the manifestation of the Observer design pattern. Another name for the Observer pattern is Pub/Sub, short for Publication/Subscription.\n\n## Diagram\n\n![Observer Pattern diagram](http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/javascript/javascript-observer.jpg)\n\nThe objects participating in this pattern are:\n\n- **Subject** - In sample code: `Click`\n - maintains list of observers. Any number of Observer objects may observe a Subject\n - implements an interface that lets observer objects subscribe or unsubscribe\n - sends a notification to its observers when its state changes\n- **Observers** - In sample code: `clickHandler`\n - has a function signature that can be invoked when Subject changes (i.e. event occurs)\n\n## Example\n\nThe `Click` object represents the *Subject*. The `clickHandler` function is the subscribing *Observer*. This handler subscribes, unsubscribes, and then subscribes itself while events are firing. It gets notified only of events #1 and #3.\n\nNotice that the fire method accepts two arguments. The first one has details about the event and the second one is the context, that is, the this value for when the eventhandlers are called. If no context is provided this will be bound to the global object (`window`).\n\nThe `log` function is a helper which collects and displays results.\n\n```js\nclass Click {\n    constructor() {\n        this.handlers = []; // observers\n    }\n\n    subscribe(fn) {\n        this.handlers.push(fn);\n    }\n\n    unsubscribe(fn) {\n        this.handlers = this.handlers.filter(item => { return item !== fn ? item : null; });\n    }\n\n    fire(o, thisObj) {\n        let scope = thisObj || window;\n        \n        this.handlers.forEach(item => { item.call(scope, o) });\n    }\n}\n\n// log helper \nlet log = (function() {\n    let log = '';\n\n    return {\n        add: msg => { log += msg + '\\n'; },\n        show: () => { alert(log); log = ''; }\n    }\n})();\n\nfunction run() {\n    var click = new Click(),\n        clickHandler = item => { log.add('fired: ' + item); };\n\n    click.subscribe(clickHandler);\n    click.fire('event #1');\n    click.unsubscribe(clickHandler);\n    click.fire('event #2');\n    click.subscribe(clickHandler);\n    click.fire('event #3');\n\n    log.show();\n}\n\nrun();\n```\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)*.

It has **fast** and **native** support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selectors, JSON, Canvas, and SVG.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n- **Headless web testing**. Lightning-fast testing without the browser is now possible! Various [test frameworks](http://phantomjs.org/headless-testing.html) such as [Jasmine](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SJSJ/blob/master/glossary/JASMINE.md), Capybara, [QUnit](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SJSJ/blob/master/glossary/QUNIT.md), [Mocha](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SJSJ/blob/master/glossary/MOCHA.md), WebDriver, YUI Test, BusterJS, FuncUnit, Robot Framework, and many others are supported.\n- **Page automation.** [Access and manipulate](http://phantomjs.org/page-automation.html) web pages with the standard DOM API, or with usual libraries like [jQuery](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SJSJ/blob/master/glossary/JQUERY.md).\n- **Screen capture.** Programmatically [capture web contents](http://phantomjs.org/screen-capture.html), including CSS, SVG and Canvas. Build server-side web graphics apps, from a screenshot service to a vector chart rasterizer.\n- **Network monitoring.** Automate performance analysis, track [page loading](http://phantomjs.org/network-monitoring.html) and export as standard HAR format.\n\n## Features\n\n- **Multiplatform**, available on major operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, and other Unices.\n- **Fast and native implementation** of web standards: DOM, CSS, JavaScript, Canvas, and SVG. No emulation!\n- **Pure headless (no X11) on Linux**, ideal for continuous integration systems. Also runs on Amazon EC2, Heroku, and Iron.io.\n- **Easy to install**: [Download](http://phantomjs.org/download.html), unpack, and start having fun in just 5 minutes.\n\n## PhantomJS usage\n\nThe PhantomJS JavaScript API can be used to open web pages, take screenshots, execute user actions, and run injected JavaScript in the page context.

    "name": "Prototype",
    "markdown": "The [Prototype](http://prototypejs.org/) JavaScript Framework is a JavaScript framework created by Sam Stephenson in February 2005 as part of the foundation for [Ajax](AJAX.md) support in Ruby on Rails. It is implemented as a single file of JavaScript code, usually named prototype.js. Prototype is distributed standalone, but also as part of larger projects, such as Ruby on Rails, script.aculo.us and Rico.\n\n## Features\n\nPrototype provides various functions for developing JavaScript applications. The features range from programming shortcuts to major functions for dealing with [XMLHttpRequest](XHR.md).\n\nPrototype also provides library functions to support classes and class-based objects, something the JavaScript language lacks. In JavaScript, object creation is prototype-based instead: an object creating function can have a prototype property, and any object assigned to that property will be used as a prototype for the objects created with that function. The Prototype framework is not to be confused with this language feature.\n\n## Sample utility functions\n\n#### The $() function\n\nThe **dollar function**, `$()`, can be used as shorthand for the `getElementById` function. To refer to an element in the [Document Object Model](DOM.md) (DOM) of an HTML page, the usual function identifying an element is:\n\n```js\ndocument.getElementById(\"id_of_element\").style.color = \"#ffffff\";\n```\n\nThe `$()` function reduces the code to:\n\n```js\n$(\"id_of_element\").setStyle({color: '#ffffff'});\n```\n\nThe `$()` function can also receive an element as parameter and will return, as in the previous example, a prototype extended object.\n\n```js\nvar domElement = document.getElementById(\"id_of_element\");  // Usual object reference returned\nvar prototypeEnhancedDomElement = $(domElement);            // Prototype extended object reference\n```\n\n#### The $F() function\n\nBuilding on the `$()` function: the `$F()` function returns the value of the requested form element. For a 'text' input, the function will return the data contained in the element. For a 'select' input element, the function will return the currently selected value.\n\n```js\n$F(\"id_of_input_element\")\n```\n\n#### The $$() function\n\nThe dollar dollar function is Prototype's *CSS Selector Engine*. It returns all matching elements, following the same rules as a selector in a CSS stylesheet. For example, if you want to get all `<a>` elements with the class \"pulsate\", you would use the following:\n\n```js\n$$(\"a.pulsate\")\n```\n\nThis returns a collection of elements. If you are using the script.aculo.us extension of the core Prototype library, you can apply the \"pulsate\" (blink) effect as follows:\n\n```js\n$$(\"a.pulsate\").each(Effect.Pulsate);\n```\n\n#### The Ajax object\n\nIn an effort to reduce the amount of code needed to run a cross-browser `XMLHttpRequest` function, Prototype provides the `Ajax` object to abstract the different browsers. It has two main methods: `Ajax.Request()` and `Ajax.Updater()`. There are two forms of the `Ajax` object. `Ajax.Request` returns the raw XML output from an AJAX call, while the `Ajax.Updater` will inject the return inside a specified DOM object. The `Ajax.Request` below finds the current values of two HTML form input elements, issues an HTTP POST request to the server with those element name/value pairs, and runs a custom function (called `showResponse` below) when the HTTP response is received from the server:\n\n```js\nnew Ajax.Request(\"http://localhost/server_script\", {\n    parameters: {\n        value1: $F(\"form_element_id_1\"),\n        value2: $F(\"form_element_id_2\")\n    },\n    onSuccess: showResponse,\n    onFailure: showError\n});\n```\n\n## Object-oriented programming\n\nPrototype also adds support for more traditional object-oriented programming. The `Class.create()` method is used to create a new class. A class is then assigned a `prototype` which acts as a blueprint for instances of the class.\n\n```js\nvar FirstClass = Class.create( {\n    // The initialize method serves as a constructor\n    initialize: function () {\n        this.data = \"Hello World\";\n    }\n});\n```\n\nExtending another class:\n\n```js\nAjax.Request = Class.create( Ajax.Base, { \n    // Override the initialize method\n    initialize: function(url, options) { \n        this.transport = Ajax.getTransport(); \n        this.setOptions(options); \n        this.request(url); \n    }, \n    // ...more methods add ... \n});\n```\n\nThe framework function `Object.extend(dest, src)` takes two objects as parameters and copies the properties of the second object to the first one simulating inheritance. The combined object is also returned as a result from the function. As in the example above, the first parameter usually creates the base object, while the second is an anonymous object used solely for defining additional properties. The entire sub-class declaration happens within the parentheses of the function call.\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n\n- [Prototype JavaScript Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_JavaScript_Framework)*.

    "markdown": "The [prototype pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_pattern) is a creational design pattern in software development. It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a [prototypical](PROTOTYPE.md) instance, which is cloned to produce new objects. This pattern is used to:\n\n- avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the abstract factory pattern does.\n- avoid the inherent cost of creating a new object in the standard way (e.g., using the `new` keyword) when it is prohibitively expensive for a given application.\n\nTo implement the pattern, declare an abstract base class that specifies a pure virtual `clone()` method. Any class that needs a \"polymorphic constructor\" capability derives itself from the abstract base class, and implements the clone() operation.\n\nThe client, instead of writing code that invokes the \"new\" operator on a hard-coded class name, calls the `clone()` method on the prototype, calls a [factory method](FACTORY_PATTERN.md) with a parameter designating the particular concrete derived class desired, or invokes the `clone()` method through some mechanism provided by another design pattern.\n\n## Structure\n\n![Prototype Pattern diagram](http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/javascript/javascript-prototype.jpg)\n\nThe objects participating in this pattern are:\n\n- **Client** - In sample code: the `run()` function.\n - creates a new object by asking a prototype to clone itself\n- **Prototype** - In sample code: `CustomerPrototype`\n - creates an interfaces to clone itself\n- **Clones** - In sample code: `Customer`\n - the cloned objects that are being created\n\n## Example\n\nIn the sample code we have a `CustomerPrototype` object that clones objects given a prototype object.

    "markdown": "In software engineering, the [singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) is a design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. The concept is sometimes generalized to systems that operate more efficiently when only one object exists, or that restrict the instantiation to a certain number of objects. The term comes from the [mathematical concept of a singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_(mathematics)).\n\nThe Singleton Pattern limits the number of instances of a particular object to just one. This single instance is called the singleton.\n\nSingletons are useful in situations where system-wide actions need to be coordinated from a single central place. An example is a database connection pool. The pool manages the creation, destruction, and lifetime of all database connections for the entire application ensuring that no connections are 'lost'.\n\nSingletons reduce the need for global variables which is particularly important in JavaScript because it limits namespace pollution and associated risk of name collisions. The [Module pattern](MODULE_PATTERN.md) is JavaScript's manifestation of the Singleton pattern.\n\n## Common uses\n\n- The [Abstract Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern), [Builder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern), and [Prototype](PROTOTYPE_PATTERN.md) patterns can use Singletons in their implementation.\n- [Facade](FACADE_PATTERN.md) objects are often singletons because only one Facade object is required.\n- [State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern) objects are often singletons.\nSingletons are often preferred to global variables because:\n - They do not pollute the global namespace (or, in languages with namespaces, their containing namespace) with unnecessary variables.\n - They permit lazy allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in many languages will always consume resources.\n\n## Structure\n\n![Singleton Pattern structure](http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/javascript/javascript-singleton.jpg)\n\nThe objects participating in this pattern are:\n\n- ``Singleton`` - In sample code: `Singleton`\n - defines `getInstance()` which returns the unique instance.\n - responsible for creating and managing the instance object.\n\n## Example\n\nThe Singleton object is implemented as an [immediate anonymous function](IIFE.md). The function executes immediately by wrapping it in brackets followed by two additional brackets. It is called anonymous because it doesn't have a name.\n\n#### Example 1\n\n```js\nvar Singleton = (function() {\n\tvar instance;\n\n\t// Private methods and fields\n\t// ...\t\n\n\t// Constructor\n\tfunction Singleton() {\n\t\tif ( !instance )\n\t\t\tinstance = this;\n\t\telse return instance;\n\n\t\t// Public fields\n\t}\n\n\t// Public methods\n\tSingleton.prototype.test = function() {};\n\n\treturn Singleton;\n})();\n\nfunction run() {\n    var instance1 = new Singleton()\n    var instance2 = new Singleton()\n \n    console.assert(instance1 === instance2);\n}\n\nrun();\n```\n\n#### Example 2\n\nThe `getInstance` method is Singleton's gatekeeper. It returns the one and only instance of the object while maintaining a private reference to it which is not accessible to the outside world.\n\nThe `getInstance` method demonstates another design pattern called **Lazy Load**. **Lazy Load** checks if an instance has already been created; if not, it creates one and stores it for future reference. All subsequent calls will receive the stored instance. Lazy loading is a CPU and memory saving technique by creating objects only when absolutely necessary.\n\n```js\nvar Singleton = (function () {\n    var instance;\n \n    function createInstance() {\n        var object = new Object('I am the instance');\n\n        return object;\n    }\n \n    return {\n        getInstance: function () {\n            if (!instance) {\n                instance = createInstance();\n            }\n\n            return instance;\n        }\n    };\n})();\n \nfunction run() {\n    var instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();\n    var instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();\n \n    console.assert(instance1 === instance2);\n}\n\nrun();\n```\n\n----------\n\n*Source:*\n- [Singleton pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern)*.

The <a href=\"MODULE_PATTERN.md\">Module pattern</a> is JavaScript&#39;s manifestation of the Singleton pattern.</p>\n<h2 id=\"common-uses\">Common uses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_factory_pattern\">Abstract Factory</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Builder_pattern\">Builder</a>, and <a href=\"PROTOTYPE_PATTERN.md\">Prototype</a> patterns can use Singletons in their implementation.</li>\n<li><a href=\"FACADE_PATTERN.md\">Facade</a> objects are often singletons because only one Facade object is required.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_pattern\">State</a> objects are often singletons.\nSingletons are often preferred to global variables because:<ul>\n<li>They do not pollute the global namespace (or, in languages with namespaces, their containing namespace) with unnecessary variables.</li>\n<li>They permit lazy allocation and initialization, whereas global variables in many languages will always consume resources.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"structure\">Structure</h2>\n<p><img src=\"http://www.dofactory.com/images/diagrams/javascript/javascript-singleton.jpg\" alt=\"Singleton Pattern structure\"></p>\n<p>The objects participating in this pattern are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Singleton</code> - In sample code: <code>Singleton</code><ul>\n<li>defines <code>getInstance()</code> which returns the unique instance.</li>\n<li>responsible for creating and managing the instance object.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example</h2>\n<p>The Singleton object is implemented as an <a href=\"IIFE.md\">immediate anonymous function</a>. The function executes immediately by wrapping it in brackets followed by two additional brackets. It is called anonymous because it doesn&#39;t have a name.</p>\n<h4 id=\"example-1\">Example 1</h4>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">var Singleton = (function() {\n    var instance;\n\n    // Private methods and fields\n    // ...    \n\n    // Constructor\n    function Singleton() {\n        if ( !instance )\n            instance = this;\n        else return instance;\n\n        // Public fields\n    }\n\n    // Public methods\n    Singleton.prototype.test = function() {};\n\n    return Singleton;\n})();\n\nfunction run() {\n    var instance1 = new Singleton()\n    var instance2 = new Singleton()\n\n    console.assert(instance1 === instance2);\n}\n\nrun();\n</code></pre>\n<h4 id=\"example-2\">Example 2</h4>\n<p>The <code>getInstance</code> method is Singleton&#39;s gatekeeper. It returns the one and only instance of the object while maintaining a private reference to it which is not accessible to the outside world.</p>\n<p>The <code>getInstance</code> method demonstates another design pattern called <strong>Lazy Load</strong>. <strong>Lazy Load</strong> checks if an instance has already been created; if not, it creates one and stores it for future reference. All subsequent calls will receive the stored instance. Lazy loading is a CPU and memory saving technique by creating objects only when absolutely necessary.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"lang-js\">var Singleton = (function () {\n    var instance;\n\n    function createInstance() {\n        var object = new Object(&#39;I am the instance&#39;);\n\n        return object;\n    }\n\n    return {\n        getInstance: function () {\n            if (!instance) {\n                instance = createInstance();\n            }\n\n            return instance;\n        }\n    };\n})();\n\nfunction run() {\n    var instance1 = Singleton.getInstance();\n    var instance2 = Singleton.getInstance();\n\n    console.assert(instance1 === instance2);\n}\n\nrun();\n</code></pre>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Source:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern\">Singleton pattern</a><em>.

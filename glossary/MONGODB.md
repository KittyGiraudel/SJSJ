# MongoDB

[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) is a fast, reliable and performant Javascript-powered **NoSQL** database. It uses the
concept of **Documents** which is a sort of JSON-like data model (called **BSON** for Binary Simple Object Model), making
querying faster and easier.

The main advantage over traditional MySQL databases is the flexibility offered by the Document Model to achieve
simpler and faster integration.

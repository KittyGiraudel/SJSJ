# Vanilla

[Vanilla](http://vanilla-js.com/) (aka VanillaJS) is a name to refer to using plain JavaScript without any additional libraries like jQuery.

It is sometimes ironically referred to as a library, as a joke for people who could be seen as mindlessly using different frameworks.

Some people have gone so far to release this library, usually with an empty or comment-only js file.

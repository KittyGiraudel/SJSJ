# VueJS

[VueJS](http://vuejs.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces (views) based on underlying data-models. Instead of only updating user data in the DOM, a data-model will be in sync to reflect the changes. Vue works through reactive data-binding. It means when you update for example a form-field, the underlying data-model is updated automatically. When other parts of the website are also bound to the same data-model, its content will update immediately.

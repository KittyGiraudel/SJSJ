_Simplified JavaScript Jargon_ (short _SJSJ_) is a community-driven attempt at explaining the loads of buzzwords making the current JavaScript ecosystem in a few simple words. The idea is not to replace individual documentations, but to act as some kind of glossary that can be easily referenced.

If you are willing to contribute, open a pull request to complete, update or fill in a section. Thank you for doing so!

**Note: while this project is fully readable from this GitHub repository, you can also enjoy the dedicated website featuring a shiny design and a search engine: [jargon.js.org](http://jargon.js.org).**

# Zepto

[Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) is a lightweight DOM library in the same flavor of [jQuery](/glossary/JQUERY.md) but faster and much lighter. Its main purpose is to provide a faster implementation for people that do not intend to support all browsers and do not
need to have all of jQuery’s features.

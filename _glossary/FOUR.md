# Four

[Four](https://github.com/allotrop3/four) is a high level graphics API based on WebGL 1.0 for developing 3D content for the web. It lets you avoid the burden of repetition and complexity to speed up and simplify the development while exposing the flexibility of the [WebGL](/_glossary/WEBGL.md) API.
